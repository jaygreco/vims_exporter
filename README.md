# VIMS to .ics Exporter

## Overview

This tool automatically exports events from a [Volunteering Integrated Management System (VIMS)](http://www.publicsafetysg.com/vims) calendar into a `.ics` file so that they can be imported into any modern calendar tool or shared.

## Background

The [Volunteering Integrated Management System (VIMS)](http://www.publicsafetysg.com/vims) is used by public service agencies to track volunteer hours, trainings, and events for their teams. As a member of my local search and rescue team, we are required to use it by the sheriffs department to report our activities in order for the department to be appropriately compensated according to the amount of time we volunteer.

However, VIMS is not modernized to say the least. While it has an integrated calendar that we're required to schedule events in, there is no way to export that calendar to modern calendar tools - such as iCal, Google Calendar, or others. That's where this tool comes in.

## Usage
